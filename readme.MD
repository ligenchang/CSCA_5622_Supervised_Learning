# Project Introduction

This project develops a supervised machine learning solution for a binary classification task: predicting whether a credit card application should be approved or denied based on 15 anonymized application attributes (mixed numeric, categorical, binary). The learning approach is supervised learning, and the problem type is binary classification. I evaluate and compare multiple algorithms: linear models (Logistic Regression), tree ensembles (Random Forest, XGBoost), and kernel methods (SVM). The objective is to build a performant classifier that supports consistent, data-driven credit decisioning.

Key elements:
- Type of Learning: Supervised Machine Learning
- Task Type: Binary Classification (Credit Approval)
- Algorithms Utilized: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine


## Project Motivation & Goals

### Motivation
Credit approval is a high-stakes decision with direct impact on both financial institutions and individuals. The UCI Credit Approval dataset, although anonymized, provides a realistic environment to practice and learn the entire machine learning workflow: from handling raw, messy data to building interpretable models that inform decision-making. There are a lot of opportunities to deal with the data cleanings.


### Primary Goal
The goal of this project is not only to build predictive models for credit approval but also to learn the core skills of applied machine learning:

- Data Preprocessing – Practice dealing with missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling continuous variables.

- Model Selection & Evaluation – Compare different classifiers, understand trade-offs between interpretability (e.g. logistic regression) and accuracy (e.g. ensemble models), and learn how to evaluate models beyond accuracy using precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curve.

- Feature Understanding – Learn to identify which features carry the most predictive power and how to interpret model outputs in a meaningful way.

- End-to-End Workflow – Develop experience in building a complete ML project pipeline: data exploration, preprocessing, training, tuning, evaluation, and communication of results.


## Data Source & Citation

### Dataset Origin
The dataset used in this project is the UCI Credit Approval dataset (also known historically as the Australian Credit Approval dataset). It contains 690 credit card applications with 15 anonymized predictor attributes (mixed categorical, binary, and continuous) and a binary target indicating approval (`+`) or denial (`-`). Attribute names and categorical value labels were intentionally obfuscated to protect confidentiality.

### How the Data Was Gathered
The original data were collected by a financial institution processing real credit applications. To enable research use while protecting privacy, identifying details and semantic meanings of variables were masked. The dataset has since been hosted in the UCI Machine Learning Repository for benchmarking classification.

### Key Characteristics
- Instances: 690
- Features: 15 anonymized applicant/application attributes
- Target: Binary approval outcome
- Has Missing Values: Yes

## Discussion and Conclusion  

### Key Learnings and Takeaways  
This project offered practical exposure to the **end-to-end machine learning workflow** and highlighted several important lessons:  

- **Impact of preprocessing on performance**: Handling missing values and standardizing continuous features (A2, A3, A8, A11, A14, A15) was critical. Algorithms like SVM and Logistic Regression benefited significantly from scaling, while robust handling of missing data (up to 1.88% in A14) improved model stability.  

- **Feature engineering as a performance driver**: One-hot encoding expanded the dataset from 15 original attributes to 44 engineered features, allowing categorical variables to be effectively represented. This step substantially improved model learning capacity.  

- **Interpretability vs. performance trade-off**:  
  - **Random Forest** achieved the highest baseline performance (92.75% accuracy, AUC-ROC 0.960).  
  - **Logistic Regression**, though less accurate (86.23% accuracy, AUC-ROC 0.953), remained valuable due to its simplicity and interpretability—an important consideration in credit approval where regulatory compliance and explainability matter.  

Overall, the workflow demonstrated that strong predictive models can be built while balancing interpretability, fairness, and efficiency.

### What Didn’t Work as Expected  
Some aspects of the project yielded less-than-expected outcomes:  

- **Minimal hyperparameter gains**: Tuning provided negligible improvements. For example, Random Forest’s AUC improved only from **0.960 → 0.9604**, suggesting either the default parameters were already well-suited or the dataset’s modest size (690 instances) limited optimization impact.  

- **Class imbalance challenges**: Despite being relatively balanced (55.51% denials vs. 44.49% approvals), models exhibited different precision-recall trade-offs:  
  - **SVM** favored recall (88.52%) at the cost of precision (83.08%).  
  - **Random Forest** provided more balanced precision and recall.  
  These differences highlight the importance of aligning the model choice with the business priority—whether to minimize false approvals (FN) or false denials (FP).  

- **Feature anonymization limits insight**: With attributes A1–A15 anonymized, it was impossible to interpret feature importance in a domain-specific way, restricting deeper business validation.

### Suggestions for Future Work  
Several directions could further improve performance and robustness:  

1. **Ensemble learning**  
   - Combine models using techniques like voting classifiers or stacking.  
   - Example: Random Forest (robust feature handling) + XGBoost (boosting power) + Logistic Regression (calibration) may yield stronger, more balanced performance.  

2. **Advanced feature engineering**  
   - Create interaction terms or polynomial features for continuous variables.  
   - Explore encoding strategies like **target encoding** for high-cardinality categorical features.  

3. **Enhanced evaluation**  
   - Use **stratified k-fold cross-validation with multiple seeds** to obtain more stable estimates.  
   - Incorporate **uncertainty quantification** for better real-world reliability.

### Final Reflection  
This project demonstrated how **machine learning success depends on more than just picking the best algorithm**. Effective preprocessing, thoughtful model selection, and careful evaluation all played equally critical roles. While Random Forest and XGBoost offered the strongest predictive results, Logistic Regression’s interpretability highlighted the trade-offs central to applied ML in high-stakes contexts.  

Ultimately, the experience reinforced that building effective models requires balancing:  
- **Predictive performance**  
- **Interpretability**  
- **Computational efficiency**  
- **Business alignment**
